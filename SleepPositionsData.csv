My dreams are very realistic, often I am doing mundane things or talking to people I know. I feel as though I have full agency over the things I do and say and I often think things during the dream. There is often object permanence to a degree - for example if I am in a house and I walk out of a room and back into it, it will be the same. In addition, if I pick something up or brush against a fabric, I can register what it feels like in a way that corresponds with reality (the weight or texture of objects around me is realistic). I also sometimes read text or look at my phone inside a dream, and am able to interpret is just like I am awake. Sorry if anything doesn‚Äôt make complete sense but I hope my response to the survey helps you out. :) Interested to see the results, dreams are weird haha :)",2,7,2,7
